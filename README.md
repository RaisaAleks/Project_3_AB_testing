# A/B Testing Analysis Project

## Overview

This project uses A/B testing to compare two versions of a digital product to determine which one performs better. The goal is to analyze the data, visualize results, and provide actionable insights.

## Project Goals

1. **Data Analysis:** Understand the structure and contents of the control and test groups.
2. **Metric Selection:** Identify key metrics for performance evaluation.
3. **Visualization:** Create charts and graphs to present findings.
4. **Insights and Recommendations:** Based on the data, provide conclusions and suggest improvements.

## Files Included

- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and code.
- `control_group_filled_updated.csv`: Data file for the control group.
- `test_group_filled_updated.csv`: Data file for the test group.
- `Project3_A_B Testing.pdf`: Presentation summarizing the findings and conclusions.

## How to Run

1. Open the `main.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the code cells to perform the data analysis and generate visualizations.
3. Review the results and insights provided in the notebook.
